# mapd

The map server the watch talks to: tiles, road vectors and routing graphs.

Replaces the PHP that used to serve `/map/`. It runs on localhost and
hiawatha reverse proxies to it, so the watch keeps talking to
`https://coredump.ws/map/` and sees no change at all. That arrangement is
deliberate: the watch's TLS is BouncyCastle speaking to hiawatha's exact
cipher configuration, and getting that working on a 2013 device took long
enough that it is not worth risking to save a hop.

## Why

A block of 256 tiles, dense city, measured on the same machine and the same
data:

| | time | bytes |
|---|---|---|
| PHP + GD | 16,320 ms | 1,441,575 |
| mapd, cold caches | 664 ms | 1,414,675 |
| mapd, warm caches | 408 ms | |

Two things account for it, and neither is Rust being fast at arithmetic.

The tiles in a block are independent and there are 256 of them, but `php-cgi`
is one process per request and rendered them one after another while seven of
the eight cores sat idle. And nothing survived a request: a decoded map cell
was thrown away when the process exited, so a block decoded the same cells a
dozen times over. Here a cell stays decoded for as long as the service runs,
and the tiles of a block are rendered across every core.

The output is an 8-bit palette PNG written without filtering. Filtering helps
a photograph, where neighbouring bytes are nearly equal, and hurts a palette
image, where they are unrelated indices - left on the encoder's default,
tiles came out nearly twice the size GD manages.

## Tiles are not cached to disk

Measured on this data: an average block renders in 120ms and reads back from
disk in 40ms, while transferring it to the watch over wifi takes 2.2 seconds.
So the cache saved four per cent of a download and cost 215MB per country -
which for Europe and America would have been tens of gigabytes.

It also had to be wiped by hand every time the rendering changed, and twice
in one week that was noticed only after the watch had already downloaded the
stale version. Rendering afresh is always correct and nearly always faster
than the network it feeds. A dense city block takes 110ms with the cell
caches warm, which they stay, because this is a service rather than a script.

Twenty recent blocks are kept in memory, which covers the watch retrying one
it failed to read - the only repeat that actually happens, since the watch
stores what it downloads.

Set `MAP_DISK_CACHE=1` to put the disk cache back.

## Running

    rc-service mapd start

Reads `MAP_ROOT` (default `/var/www/hiawatha/map`) and `MAP_ADDR` (default
`127.0.0.1:8088`). Runs as `hiawatha` so the tile cache it writes is the one
the web server can read.

## Alerts

`/alerts.php?c=<country>` returns the speed cameras, motorway junctions and
filling stations for a country, and with `&w=&s=&e=&n=` for a box of it.

Built from the store per request rather than served from a file. It started as
a precomputed artifact and that was the wrong shape twice over: the file goes
stale against the store it came from, and a country is all a caller can ask
for - a continent's cameras are not a sensible download for a watch that only
needs the ones around it. The store is already indexed by cell, so a box costs
a box: the Netherlands is 114 kB whole, 3 kB around one town.

There is no PHP equivalent. Everything else here has one because it was ported
from one; this never existed in PHP, and a second implementation of the format
is a second thing to keep in step.

A store built before `import_points.php` has no points table and gets an empty
layer rather than an error, which the watch reads as "nothing here".

`MAP_OSRM` (default `https://router.project-osrm.org`) is where `/route.php`
goes. The watch routes on the graph on its own card whenever it has one, so
this endpoint only answers for a country that has not been downloaded - but
that is exactly the case where the watch cannot fall back on itself, so it is
worth pointing at an OSRM you run. The default is the project's demo server,
which is explicitly not offered for production use: it rate-limits, it makes
no uptime promise, and it sees every destination the watch is sent to.

## Going back

The PHP is still in `/var/www/hiawatha/map` and still works. Comment out the
`ReverseProxy = ^/map/` line in hiawatha.conf and reload.

## Endpoints

Identical to the PHP, including the `.php` in the paths - the watch has those
URLs compiled in, and a rename would be a flag day for no benefit.

| | |
|---|---|
| `pack.php` | a 16x16 block of tiles in one response |
| `tile.php` | a single tile |
| `country.php` | which country covers a position, or every country present |
| `graph.php` | a routing graph, whole or cut to a bounding box |
| `route.php` | a route, proxied from OSRM and cached a day |
| `health` | for checking it is up |

A country need not be named: tile numbers are global, so `mapd` works out
which database to render from by where the request is asking about.

## TODO: WRT2, the roundabout exit

`server/map/route.php` gained this on 30 August (`ca8dfb8`) and **mapd did not**,
which means it is not live: hiawatha has `ReverseProxy = ^/map/ 0
http://127.0.0.1:8088`, so every `/map/` request the watch makes is answered
here, and the PHP is the fallback path that nothing currently uses. A route
fetched from the running server today is still `WRT1`.

That matters more than a missing feature, because the launcher half has landed
too (`1e45ff0`, "Say which exit to take at a roundabout"). A watch that expects
WRT2 against a server still sending WRT1 reads an 11 byte step as 12: the first
step parses, and every step after it is garbage. The compatibility note on the
PHP commit - "the watch still reads WRT1, so a server that has not been updated
keeps working" - covers old watch against new server, not this direction. So the
launcher build is deliberately not published until this is done.

The change, in `src/route_encode.rs`:

- The steps vector is `Vec<(u8, u16, f64, f64)>` at line 58; it needs an exit
  byte: `Vec<(u8, u8, u16, f64, f64)>`.
- The exit is already in hand. This parses OSRM's own JSON, so alongside
  `maneuver.type` and `maneuver.modifier` there is `maneuver.exit` - read it as
  `m.get("exit").and_then(|v| v.as_u64()).unwrap_or(0).min(255) as u8`.
- Take it whenever OSRM offers it rather than only for the types that map to a
  roundabout turn code. The PHP does the same, for the reason given there: a
  rotary that came through as a plain left is still a rotary and the number is
  still right.
- `b"WRT1"` becomes `b"WRT2"` at line 92, the exit byte is pushed straight after
  the turn byte in the loop at line 97, and the capacity hint at line 91 goes
  from `steps.len() * 11` to `* 12`.
- The module doc at the top of the file states the layout and should say
  `u8 turn  u8 exit  u16 metres  i32 lat  i32 lon`.

If mapd caches encoded routes anywhere, the key needs a version marker for the
same reason the PHP added `.v2.bin` - otherwise yesterday's WRT1 files keep
being served and the exits appear whenever the cache turns over.

Deploy is `cargo build --release`, `install -m755 target/release/mapd
/usr/local/bin/mapd`, `rc-service mapd restart`. Verify with a route fetch: the
first four bytes should read WRT2, and the header is big-endian.
