/**
 * The position and speed as the server already has them.
 *
 * This is the best of the three sources. The watch's own location frames carry
 * no coordinates indoors, so nothing local can measure a speed from them; the
 * server resolves those WiFi and cell readings into a real position and then
 * computes the speed between consecutive fixes. Asking it is both simpler and
 * more accurate than reproducing it here.
 *
 * It is the same request the tracker web page makes:
 *
 * <pre>
 * current.php?imei=&lt;imei&gt;&amp;viewonly=&lt;token&gt;
 *   -&gt; 2026-08-25T17:39:58Z,52.061901,5.108445,0.044441,2
 *      time                  lat       lon      km/h     fix type
 * </pre>
 *
 * Fix type is CTracker's: 0 GPS, 1 cell tower, 2 WiFi. It matters, because the
 * server refuses to measure a speed against a cell fix -- those hop kilometres
 * as the serving tower changes -- so a type 1 row carries no usable speed and
 * none is shown for one.
 *
 * <h3>Why the URL is not in this file</h3>
 *
 * That URL carries the watch's IMEI and a view-only token, and together they
 * are read access to its live location and its history. This APK is published
 * on a public web server for anyone to download, so a URL compiled into it
 * would hand that access to anyone who fetched the file. It is read from the
 * watch's own storage instead, the same way contacts are:
 *
 * <pre>
 * adb push tracker.txt /sdcard/Documents/
 * </pre>
 *
 * one line, the whole URL. The repository keeps per-unit identifiers out of
 * git for exactly the same reason, and the token can be regenerated from the
 * tracker page if it ever gets out.
 *
 * <h3>Why this may report SSLHandshake</h3>
 *
 * This watch cannot complete a TLS handshake with a modern server: it offers
 * only ECDHE with AES-GCM, and GCM arrived in Android's TLS stack at API 20
 * while this device is 19. Bundled CA roots do not help, because the failure
 * happens before any certificate is examined.
 *
 * The URL is deliberately not downgraded to http automatically. It carries a
 * token that reads a location history, and quietly putting that on the wire is
 * not a decision an app should make on its owner's behalf. Writing an http URL
 * into tracker.txt is a decision the owner can make.
